# Network Security Exploration: Snort, Suricata, pfSense & Attack Tools
This repository documents my exploration of network security tools, focusing on both defensive and offensive aspects. It includes detailed configurations, analysis, and hands-on experiments with:

## Defensive Tools:
Snort – Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDS/IPS)
Suricata – High-performance IDS, IPS, and network monitoring engine
pfSense – Open-source firewall and router for network security

## Offensive Tools:
Common attack tools and techniques used to test and evaluate defensive mechanisms.

## Repository Contents:
Installation guides for Snort, Suricata, and pfSense
Configuration files and rule tuning for IDS/IPS
Attack simulations to test detection capabilities
Analysis of alerts, logs, and performance metrics
Comparative study of Snort vs. Suricata

This repository serves as a reference for setting up, analyzing, and testing network security defenses.
